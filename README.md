# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This project implements a comprehensive traffic sign classification system using deep learning techniques on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The system compares two different neural network architectures to achieve high-accuracy traffic sign recognition.
